acts_as_bitfield
=========
This is a Rails 2.3 compatible fork of the acts_as_bitfield plugin by Gabriel Gironda from:

http://code.helicoid.net/svn/rails/plugins/acts_as_bitfield

The Rails 2.3 compatibility was achieved by changing construct_conditions_from_arguments to invoke attribute_conditions with two arguments instead of one.
